## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure API Key

The system automatically creates `~/.tiny-claude-code/settings.json` on first run. Configure your API keys using any of these methods:

**Method 1: Configuration File (Recommended)**

Edit `~/.tiny-claude-code/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "model": {
    "provider": "kimi", // Choose: "anthropic", "openai", "kimi"
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "max_tokens": 4000
  },
  "providers": {
    "anthropic": {
      "api_key": "your-anthropic-key",
      "model_name": "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929",
      "api_base": "https://api.anthropic.com/v1"
    },
    "openai": {
      "api_key": "your-openai-key",
      "model_name": "gpt-4o",
      "api_base": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    },
    "kimi": {
      "api_key": "your-kimi-key",
      "model_name": "kimi-k2-thinking",
      "api_base": "https://api.moonshot.cn/v1"
    }
  }
}
```

**Method 2: Environment Variables (Override config file)**

```bash
# For Anthropic Claude
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-anthropic-key"
export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"  # Optional
export ANTHROPIC_API_BASE="https://api.anthropic.com/v1"  # Optional

# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-key"
export OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o"  # Optional
export OPENAI_API_BASE="https://api.openai.com/v1"  # Optional

# For Moonshot Kimi (dedicated provider)
export KIMI_API_KEY="your-kimi-key"
export KIMI_MODEL="kimi-k2-thinking"  # Optional
export KIMI_API_BASE="https://api.moonshot.cn/v1"  # Optional

# Select which provider to use
export MODEL_PROVIDER="kimi"  # or "anthropic", "openai"
```

**Method 3: .env File (Local project configuration)**

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file with your API keys
```

**Configuration Priority:** Environment Variables > .env File > settings.json

### 3. Platform-Specific Requirements (Optional)

#### macOS: ESC Cancellation Feature

To enable interrupting long-running operations with the ESC key, you need to grant Accessibility permissions:

1. **Open System Settings** (System Preferences on older macOS)
2. **Navigate to:** Privacy & Security → Accessibility
3. **Click the lock icon** and authenticate
4. **Add your terminal app:**
   - Terminal.app (built-in macOS terminal)
   - iTerm2
   - VS Code
   - Or your current terminal emulator
5. **Restart the CLI**

**Check status:** Run `/check-permissions` command in the CLI to diagnose permission issues.

**Note:** The CLI works without these permissions, but you won't be able to cancel operations with ESC. You can still use Ctrl+C or the `/exit` command.

#### Linux & Windows

No special permissions required. ESC cancellation should work out of the box.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python -m src.main
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

This project uses a layered architecture design that decomposes complex AI Agent systems into manageable modules.

### Key Architecture Components

- **Agent State Machine (FSM)**: IDLE → THINKING → USING_TOOL → WAITING_FOR_RESULT → COMPLETED/ERROR
- **Reactive UI System**: Dynamic mode switching between REACTIVE (live display) and INTERACTIVE (sync input)
- **UI Coordinator**: Manages mode transitions during permission requests
- **Permission System**: 3-tier access control (SAFE/NORMAL/DANGEROUS) with 4 modes (ALWAYS_ASK, AUTO_APPROVE_SAFE, AUTO_APPROVE_ALL, SKIP_ALL)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: 19 event types with EventBus pub-sub pattern
- **Hook System**: 19 hook event types with priority-based execution
- **Session Management**: Automatic persistence, command history tracking, session restoration
- **Checkpoint & Recovery**: Step-level checkpoints, context snapshots, state restoration
- **Action Logging System**: Async queue + background worker, 17 ActionTypes, data masking, JSON Lines format with daily rotation

## 🧪 Testing

This project includes a comprehensive test suite with **1,800+ tests** and **70%+ code coverage**.

### Test Organization

Tests are organized by type following pytest best practices:

```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

Encountered problems? Find diagnostic guides and solutions for common issues:

### ESC Cancellation Not Working

**Problem:** Pressing ESC doesn't interrupt long-running operations.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check permissions (macOS)**:
   ```bash
   # In the CLI, run:
   /check-permissions
   ```
   - If permissions are missing, follow the steps shown in the diagnostic output
   - Grant Accessibility permissions to your terminal app in System Settings

2. **Verify feature is enabled**:
   - Look for warning message on CLI startup
   - If you see "ESC Cancellation Unavailable", follow the instructions

3. **Alternative cancellation methods**:
   - Use Ctrl+C (SIGINT)
   - Use `/exit` command
   - Wait for operation to complete
